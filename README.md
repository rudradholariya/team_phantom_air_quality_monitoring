OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:
The objective of a project on air quality monitoring is to:

Measure Air Pollution Levels: Identify and quantify pollutants such as CO2, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 in the atmosphere.
Assess Environmental Impact: Evaluate how air pollution affects human health, plants, animals, and the ecosystem.
Create Awareness: Inform stakeholders about air quality trends and their consequences.
Promote Action: Suggest measures to reduce air pollution based on collected data and analysis.
Develop Technology: Design low-cost and efficient air monitoring systems for continuous and real-time analysis.
Support Policy: Provide data to policymakers to draft effective environmental regulations.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
1.matplotlib
2.pandas
3.numpy

DATA SOURCE:
from Kaggle.com

EXECUTING STEPS:
1.First copy the python file from github and paste this to your internal storage.
2.After copying open the python file from any python app(Example:vscode,idle).
3.After opening press f5 from your keyboard.
4.Then the code will run and you will see the graph data analysis output.

SUMMARY:
Air quality monitoring involves measuring and analyzing pollutants like CO2, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 to assess environmental and health impacts. The project aims to create awareness about pollution levels, develop cost-effective monitoring systems, and provide data to support environmental policies. It emphasizes understanding pollution trends, promoting sustainable practices, and encouraging action to improve air quality for a healthier ecosystem.

CHALLENGES FACED:
1.Code Errors
2.Module Errors
